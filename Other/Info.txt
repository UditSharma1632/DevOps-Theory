###################################################        Linux Structure		#########################################


		Linux has 3 standard streams 						->streams basically means transfer data
		stdin 0
		stdout 1
		stderr 2
		
		
		Pipe |   -> redirects
		
		Process access information through env variables
		
		
		1.	All processes are managed by kernel and they have unique process id.
		2.  init is the mother process of all processes
		
		
		
		-> Symlinks , Aliases, Shortcut
		
		
	#######################################  Boot process  #############################	
		
					Boot Process:
					
						1. BIOS - Basic input output system
						2. BootLoader     (GRUB is most common)
						3. Kernel -> initializes memory & device and loads init process
						4. init   -> it is mother process
									
			
			
							3 level of abstraction in linux os
							
								1. Hardware -> cpu, memory, ports
								2. Kernel
								3. user space
								
								
								
								
							Privilege level           (protection ring)
								kernel -> kernel mode
								User   -> user mode 
										User uses system (sys) calls to request kernel to perform an action on hardware
										
										
							
							Init implementation:
							
								1. System v - traditional
								2. Upstart - old
								3. Systemd - mnew
								
								
									system v -> starts and stops processes sequentially
									upstart  -> uses events and jobs model
												jobs   -> actions performed
												events -> messages received from other processes that triggered the job
									systemd  -> uses goals to get system up and running
									
									working of systemd
										1. Loads config files from /etc/systemd and /lib/systemd/system
												  -> default.target has all the targets/goals
												  
												  Targets:
													1. poweroff.target   -> shutdown
													2. rescue.target	 -> single user
													3. multi-user.target -> multi users with networking
													4. garphical.target  -> multi user with networking and GUI
													5. reboot.target	 -> reboot
